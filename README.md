# BES Data Analysis and Clustering Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project, developed during an internship with ISTAT, is part of the Masterâ€™s in Data Science program at the University of Campania L. Vanvitelli. It focuses on analyzing Italy's **Benessere Equo e Sostenibile** (BES) indicators across provinces to reveal patterns and relationships in wellbeing. The project includes an interactive dashboard for exploring these indicators over time and by region.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Uses Python libraries like Pandas and Plotly to preprocess, analyze, and visualize BES data.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Implements a Clusterwise Regression model to analyze social and health inequalities, grouping provinces based on BES indicators.
3. **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Plotly and Dash, allowing users to interact with and explore the data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly dash


### Running the Dashboard
1. ** Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
